1. Created the three threads for readtemperature, readaccelometer, and switchpress 
2. Created two timer functions one for print the RTC data for every one second and one for print the sensor's data every 1 min.
3. configured the external interrupts for switch and accelometer sensor.
4. Integrated the Temperature and accelometer code with rtos.
5. initially for every one second the time will be printed in the tera-term.
6. when user pressed the switch then sensors data will be printed in the tera-term.
7. for  every 1 min sensors data will be printed.
